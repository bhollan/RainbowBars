Sanity check while learning D3

OK, so I've worked in software for years now, I just can't show you any of it. I worked at Lockheed Martin and made some GUIs, wrote some test software for hardware testers and did Integration work on it for a few years. I just can't show any of it to you.

So here I am, learning javascript and building anything that sounds fun and cool so that I can show it to the world to prove that I actually know what I'm talking about. So there you go.
